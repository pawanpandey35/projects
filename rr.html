                        <li>Please ensure that all children under 14 years of age wear seat belts or sit in an
                        approved child restraint.</li>

                        <li>Driving in fatigue enhances the probability of an accident. To minimize this risk you
                        must follow these rules: </li>  </br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Make sure you are fit to drive. Do not undertake a long journey (longer than an hour)
                        if you feel tired.</li>

                        <li>Avoid undertaking long journeys between midnight and early morning hours, when natural
                        alertness is at its worst.</li>

                        <li>Plan your journey in breaks. A minimum break of at least 15 minutes after every two
                        hours of driving is recommended.</li>

                        <li>If you feel sleepy, stop at a safe place. Do not stop on the hard shoulder of a
                        motorway</li>

                        <li>The most effective ways to counter sleepiness are to take a short nap (up to 15
                        minutes) or drink, for example, two cups of strong coffee. Fresh air, exercise or turning up the radio may
                        help for a short time, but are not as effective.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <li>Children in cars. Drivers who are carrying children in cars should ensure that :</li></br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Children do not sit behind the rear seats in an estate car or hatchback, unless a
                        special child seat has been fitted.</li>

                        <li>The child safety door locks, where fitted, are used when children are in the car.</li>

                        <li>Children are kept under control.</li>

                        <li>A rear-facing baby seat is never fitted into a seat protected by an AIRBAG.</li>
                        </ol>
