                    The process in brief:</br></br>

                    Fill the online form from DOTM website. You'll get a verification page along with time. In case the
                    page doesnot open, wait until the DOTM Server is up. We see most problem with DOTM website caused by
                    a lot of triffic at same time. The problem possibly seen for the few days after DOTM open up
                    registration. And you won't be able to fill mannal form these days. List of License Issue Office for
                    Bagmati Zone are: Jagati-Bhaktapur, Thulobharayang-Kathmandu, Chabhil-Kathmandu, and
                    Bagmati-Lalitpur.</br></br>
                    2. Print the confirmation page and take along your national identity card (citizenship) and visit
                    the DOTM office. The date of visit is mentioned in confirmation page.</br></br>

                    3. Your citizenship as well as biometric details will be recorded there. Once done you'll be advised
                    to get your eyes and blood group checked. (Eyes and blood test service is available near DOTM
                    office).</br></br>

                    4. Now you should pay Nrs.500 for a written exam. Usually, the exam is next day 7:00 am. In case you
                    have any licence (bike, car or any) and applying for add category like a car, you don't need to take
                    the written exam. In general sense, if you have any vehicle licence you don't need to attain written
                    exam.</br></br>


                    5. Once you pass the exam you will be able to attend for vehicle trial next day (bike or car or any
                    you intend to apply for). They'll inform where and when to attend. Bike on rent costs Rs.50 and
                    Rs.500 for car hire on the trial centre.(Only for Bagmati-Lalitpur)</br></br>

            <p>
                    6. Once you pass trial you should visit DOTM office and pay revenue Rs.1500 after 10 working days
                    (In case of new license). For add category you just need to pay Rs.500. You'll receive a payment
                    slip along with license number. Also, they'll inform about approx time to collection your license.
                    Till then you will be able to run vehicle using the payment slip (Rajaswa Paper).
